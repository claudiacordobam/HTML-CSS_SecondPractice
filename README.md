# HTML-CSS_SecondPractice
This repository contains the second page I created as part of the HTML and CSS subject of the Bachelor's Degree in Multimedia.
This subject took place during the Spring semester of the scholar year 2023-2024.
Just like in the [first practical exercise(https://github.com/claudiacordobam/HTML-CSS_FirstPractice)], we were asked to replicate a webpage from a screenshot that we were provided with. Furthermore, the exercise's prompt also
required students to create a design that was WCAG-compliant. The colour contrasts, thus, were fixed, so that all colour pairings had a contrast of a minimum of 4.5. Some of the design adaptations that were made in order to take into
account the Accessibility Guidelines were:
-Alternative texts were added to descrive relevant non-textual content
-The :focus-within CSS pseudo-class was included in order to make the :hover elements inclusive for keyboard users
-An HTML language attribute was included in those parts of the page that incorporate fragments in Spanish or Catalan
