      <h2>Theoretical framework</h2>
      <p class="article-p">
        <span class="author">Andrea Rosales Climent</span>
        analyses various cultural
        products
        within a theoretical framework concerning these
        perspectives:
        unfair practices, practices against user interest,
        hidden
        information, illegitimate manipulative personalization,
        the exploitation of users’ vulnerability, the right to
        equal
        treatment and the right to be treated with dignity.
      </p>
      <p class="article-p">
        The expert analyses the imaginaries about automation and
        algorithmic systems in two cultural products. Automation
        imaginaries are already embroidered in culture. Writers,
        journalists and documentalists contribute to the
        construction
        of the related imaginaries and, at the same time, embed
        the
        imaginaries of the society in their products. I
        particularly
        analyse two best-seller books:
      </p>
      <ul class="ethics-ul">
        <li><span class="book">Uncanny Valley</span>,
          by <span class="author">Anna Wiener</span></li>
        <li><span class="book">Quality Land</span>,
          by <span class="author">Marc-Uwe Kling</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="article-p">
        <span class="book">Uncanny Valley</span> shows the
        techno-optimism of most tech
        workers who are not aware or are not interested in being
        aware,
        of the
        potential social implications of the technologies they
        develop.
        The author shows how tech culture contributes to
        creating this
        believer team, where employees are <q>Down for the cause
          of
          the
          project</q>, and any critical view is disregarded.
        In the
        book
        <!--I have used q to format "Down for the (...)" as <cite> is usually used with an author or a source-->
        <span class="author">Wiener</span> shares her memoirs as
        a misfit employed of the
        <span class="place">Silicon Valley</span>. A privileged
        standpoint
        to observe the culture of the tech companies in the
        <span class="place">Silicon Valley</span>.

      </p>
      <p class="article-p">
        Throughout the book, the author reflects on the moral
        implications
        of data collection and manipulation among technology
        companies:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="blockquote-text">Silicon Valley might have promoted a style of individualism, but scale bred
          homogeneity</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="article-p">
        The tech culture in <span class="place">Silicon
          Valley</span> is very
        much part of the worker’s imagery. <span class="author">Rosales</span>
        pointed out that most tech workers are not interested in
        dealing with data ethics
        problems and are totally into the techno-optimistic
        approach. This means
        that there is a general belief among workers that
        technological developments
        will do more good for humanity than harm, that the
        solution to people’s problems
        lies in technological innovation, and that they are
        actually the ones solving these
        problems.
