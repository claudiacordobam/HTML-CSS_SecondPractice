        The
        <q>Data Society Research Seminar: Behind Data
          and Algorithms -
          Actors, logics and cultures behind digital technologies</q>
        took place last week on 16 June at
        <span class="place">Malmö University</span>. There to speak at
        the event were
        <span class="author">Andrea Rosales Climent</span> and
        <span class="author">Sara Suárez-Gonzalo</span>, researchers from
        the
        <abbr title="International Informatics Institute" class="p-abbr">IN3</abbr>. The seminar was organized by
        <span class="place">Malmö University’s Data
          Society research programme</span>.

        Data and algorithms are intensively put in the public eye and have
        been on the research agenda for some time, prompting studies on
        biased systems regarding gender, ethnicity and now age. Researching
        the actors, logic and cultures behind data can lead academics to key
        insights into how algorithms embody rules, furthering discussions on
        power in today’s data society.

        Over the last 20 years, digital technology and the internet have
        completely changed our mindsets. The internet was initially seen as
        a new world of amazing capabilities, but the digital revolution now
        threatens to undermine values such as personal freedom, democracy,
        trustworthy knowledge and even open competition. The future looks
        more like a dystopian universe than a utopian digital world. Words
        like monopoly, surveillance and disinformation describe the most
        pressing problems in this rather fearful internet setting. It
        sometimes feels like we live in a technological regime where our
        privacy is not respected anymore. In order to have any hope of
        recovering the promise of new technology, these problems need to be
        fixed.

      <h2>Data domination: the effects of mass surveillance</h2>
      <p class="article-p">
        <span class="author">Sara Suárez-Gonzalo</span> focused her talk on
        explaining how neo-republican theory can help us to better
        understand and deal with the effects of big data exploitation, mass
        surveillance and the way they shape social power relations.
      </p>
      <p class="article-p">
        The hegemonic framework for the discussion of the social and
        political effects of data-driven technologies is the liberal
        conception of the values of privacy and freedom (traditionally
        defined by liberalism as non-interference).

      <h2>A new perspective</h2>
      <p class="article-p">
        There is no control of privacy nowadays; this is seen in the need to
        accept cookies from regular websites to do any daily task on a
        computer. Surveillance strips people of control over their freedom
        to remain private, thus taking away their right to privacy.
        Overcoming data domination will mean defying the liberal hegemonic
        conception of privacy and accepting that leaving people alone to do
        as they please is not enough. We need to rethink a possible feminist
        and neo-republican perspective. For that,
        <span class="author">Suárez-Gonzalo</span> proposed two conditions:
      </p>
      <ul class="index-ul">
        <li>
          Everyone must be provided with the material and immaterial
          resources necessary to keep the potential forms of domination in
          check. This means guaranteeing universal education on digital
          issues and bridging the digital divides affecting some parts of
          the population that are unable to keep up with technological
          development.
        </li>
        <li>
          Structural conditions, such as restrictions of policy, that give
          control to big tech companies must be avoided. This means
          preventing them from exercising their power on public institutions
          and imposing restrictions on the monopolistic dynamics of the
          economy that guide the technological business model.
        </li>
      </ul>
